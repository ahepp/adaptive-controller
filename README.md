# adaptive-controller

An Arduino ecosystem HID device with joystick and sip n' puff components.

The joystick code should be compatible with any potentiometer based analog joystick. The pressure sensor is a [Honeywell MPRLS](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3965).

Conceptually these components would be combined with a 3d printed housing and stand holding them at mouth level, allowing simple control of a computer for people unable to use their hands.
